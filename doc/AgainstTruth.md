# Against Truth

> Hey, what IS truth, man? [Beeblebrox, quoted in [Adams, 1978]]

*This title is, of course, a respectful nod to Feyerabend's Against Method*

## Introduction

This document is in two parts: a  statement of a problem, and an account of an attempt to address  it. The problem is stated briefly in the first chapter, and  fleshed out in the following two with a history of attempts which  have been made in the past to address it, and an analysis of what  would be needed to solve it.

The second part starts with an  account of a system built by the author in collaboration with  Peter Mott, describing particularly how the problem was addressed  by this system; subsequent chapters will describe the development  of a further system, in which the analysis developed in the first  section will be applied.

This document deals only with  explanation. Issues relating to inference and especially to truth  maintenance will undoubtedly be raised as it progresses, but such  hares will resolutely not be followed.
