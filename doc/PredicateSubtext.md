# On the subtext of a predicate

Predicates are not atomic. They do not come single spies, but freighted
with battalions of inferable subtexts. Suppose Anthony says

    Brutus killed Caesar in Rome during the ides of March

I learn more than just that 'Brutus killed Caesar in Rome during the
ides of March'. I also learn that

-   Brutus is a killer
-   Caesar has been killed
-   Rome is a place where killings happen
-   The ides of March are a time to be extra cautious

Suppose Drusilla now says

    Longus killed Caesar in Rome during the ides of March

this casts doubt on Anthony's primary claim, and on the belief that
Brutus is a killer; but it reinforces the beliefs that

-   Caesar has been killed
-   Rome is a place where killings happen
-   The ides of March are a time to be extra cautious.

If Falco then says

    No, I heard from Gaius that it happened in April

the beliefs that

-   Caesar has been killed
-   Rome is a place where killings happen

are still further strengthened.

In proposing a formalism to express predicates, we need to consider how
it allows this freight to be unpacked.
