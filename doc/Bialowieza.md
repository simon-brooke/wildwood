# Bialowieza

{not yet written. To cover development of the Clojure Wildwood library, and the thinking and design which develops as I do it}

## Why Bialowieza?

Bialowieza is the second iteration of the Wildwood engine, and this following convention its name should start with 'B'. [Białowieża](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bia%C5%82owie%C5%BCa) is Europe's last great wild wood, and it is currently under threat.
