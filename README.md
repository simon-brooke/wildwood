# wildwood

A general inference library using a game theoretic inference mechanism.

## Warning

There's nothing much here yet, I'm just starting to rebuild.

## Current motivation

Although the design of Wildwood was originally intended as part of [a joint AI/Philosophy PhD thesis](https://simon-brooke.github.io/wildwood/codox/AgainstTruth.html), I'm currently rebuilding it because I need it to support some computer game funtionality I'm working on. I'm building it as a library so that it should have no dependencies on the game code, and that it should be possible to hook it up to other knowledge sources. Doing that, however, will probably be left as an exercise for the reader.

## Usage

You can't, it doesn't work yet. For more information, read the (copious) [docs](https://simon-brooke.github.io/wildwood)
