<h2><a href="#history-introduction" name="history-introduction"></a>History: Introduction</h2>
<p>The object of this chapter is to describe and discuss the development of Expert System explanations from the beginning’ to the most recent systems. The argument which I will try to advance is that development has been continuously driven by the perceived inadequacy of the explanations given; and that, while many ad hoc, and some principled, approaches have been tried, no really adequate explanation system has emerged. Further, I will claim that, as some of the later and more principled explanation systems accurately model the accounts of explanation advanced in current philosophy, the philosophical understanding of explanation is itself inadequate.</p>
<p>{I ought to add to this chapter to give some overview of what’s happened since 1990, and look at explanations of neural network decisions, because that will help in later parts/chapters of Part One}</p>
<h2><a href="#family-tree-of-systems-discussed" name="family-tree-of-systems-discussed"></a>Family Tree of Systems discussed</h2>
<p><img src="../img/family-tree.svg" alt="Family tree" /></p>
<p>Chronology relates to publication, and not to implementation. Links are shown where system designers acknowledge influence, or where family resemblance between systems is extremely obvious. In a small field like this, it is reasonably (but not absolutely) safe to assume that major practitioners are up to date with the current literature.</p>
<p>Contrary to the current view, expressed by such authors as Weiner:</p>
<p>“… (Expert) systems include some mechanism for giving explanations, since their credibility depends on the user’s ability to follow their reasoning, thereby verifying that an answer is correct.” [Weiner, 80]</p>
<p>This view might be paraphrased as saying that an explanation generator is an intrinsic and essential part of an expert system. By contrast, the first thing that I intend to argue is that:</p>
<h2><a href="#the-earliest-systems-contained-no-explanation-facilities" name="the-earliest-systems-contained-no-explanation-facilities"></a>The earliest systems contained no explanation facilities</h2>
<p>Two of the famous early expert systems, Internist [Pople 77] and Macsyma [Martin &amp; Fateman 71] did not have anything approaching an explanation system and made no claims to have one. Consequently, these will not be discussed at any length here. One other, Dendral, had a command ‘EXPLAIN’; and the last, MYCIN, is famous for its explanations. To maintain my claim that neither of these systems had, in their original conception, what we would recognise as an explanation system, we will examine them in detail.</p>
<h2><a href="#dendral" name="dendral"></a>Dendral</h2>
<h3><a href="#general-description-of-the-system" name="general-description-of-the-system"></a>General description of the system</h3>
<p>Dendral is one of the earliest programmes which are conventionally included in the history of Expert Systems. As Jackson says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“DENDRAL can be seen as a kind of stepping stone between the older, general-purpose problem solving programs and more recent approaches involving the explicit representation of domain knowledge.” [Jackson 86 p 19]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The system is designed to deduce the molecular structure of an organic compound from mass-spectrum analysis. It differs from the modern, post MYCIN, conception of an ‘expert system’ - or indeed even the weaker conception of a ‘knowledge based system’- in a number of ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, it operates in ‘batch-mode’ - that is, when the system is started, it prompts the user for input, and then ‘goes away’ and analyses this without further interaction. When this is completed, it outputs a report.</p>
<p>Secondly, the program explicitly implements an algorithm, which is described [Buchanan et al 69, section 7].</p>
<p>Most significantly for the purpose of the current argument, although an attempt is made to produce information from which a justification of the conclusion could be reconstructed (by printing out the states of some internal variables at the end of the run), and although the function which causes the state of the variables to be printed is called ‘EXPLAIN’, there is no ‘explanation facility’ as currently understood. This lack is partially made good by a ‘speak’ option, which causes information about the current hypothesis to be printed out at each stage in the inference process.</p>

<h3><a href="#dendral-as-an-expert-system" name="dendral-as-an-expert-system"></a>DENDRAL as an Expert System</h3>
<p>So why should DENDRAL be considered an ‘Expert System’? The programme consists of two major components, a ‘structure generator’ and a ‘evaluation function’. Both of these incorporate inference mechanisms, supported by explicit representations of knowledge.</p>
<h3><a href="#the-generate-stage" name="the-generate-stage"></a>The ‘Generate’ stage</h3>
<p>The input data gives approximate information about the relative quantities of different ion-masses in the compound, and consequently roughly suggests the proportions of elements present. The ’structure generator generates compounds compatible with the analysis data, by exploiting knowledge about possible and impossible atomic bonds. This knowledge appears to be held essentially as patterns, against which generated patterns are matched. Two primary collections of patterns are maintained, a ‘badlist’ and a ‘goodlist’. The badlist comprises, initially, those primitive compounds which cannot exist in nature; those compounds which are ruled out by features of the input data are added.</p>
<h3><a href="#the-test-stage" name="the-test-stage"></a>The ‘Test’ stage</h3>
<p>The evaluation function takes structures passed by the generator, and uses a predictor to calculate what the spectrum to be expected from this structure would be. It then compares this against the spectrum originally entered, and scores it for similarity.</p>
<p>The predictor uses some form of a rule engine. My caution in that statement derives from the extremely technical nature of the passage in [Buchanan et al 69, section 4], and the fact that no actual examples of rules given. These rules determine the way in which a compound is likely to break down under conditions inside the spectrometer, and what new compounds in what proportion will be the products of these breakdowns; generally the form of the rule appears to be a pair:</p>
<pre><code>(&lt;compound-specification&gt; ·  &lt;product-specification&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>where <compound-specification> is a description of a compound or class of compounds, and <product-specification> may be a list of compound specifications with information about their proportions, or may, where it is uncertain what the precise products would be, or no further decomposition is likely, be spectrum fragments. The spectrum fragments which form the nodes of the decomposition graph are then summed to generate a ‘predicted spectrum’.</product-specification></compound-specification></p>
<p>So that it appears that two main inference mechanisms are employed in DENDRAL: a simple pattern matcher helps to generate hypotheses, and a more sophisticated forward chaining mechanism supports the test stage, eliminating the impossible ones. Summary</p>
<p>It is clear from the above that DENDRAL is an ‘Intelligent knowledge Based System’; but the absence of any high-level explanation or justification system, or any method of exploring the inference interactively with the machine, make it very different from what we now think of as an ‘expert system’.</p>
<p>Despite this, DENDRAL has a very direct relevance to the present project: as [Buchanan &amp; Feigenbaum 78] report:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Another concern has been to exploit the AI methodology to understand better some fundamental questions in the philosophy of science, for example the processes by which explanatory hypotheses are discovered or judged adequate.” (Buchanan &amp; Feigenbaum 78, p 5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus DENDRAL set out to contribute to exactly the same debate that I am addressing.</p>
<p>Interestingly, although later developments of the DENDRAL family included interactive editing of hypotheses, and although Buchanan was involved in the MYCIN project in the interim, no explanation facility had been added to the system by 1978, the date of the later of these two papers. This may be seen as providing some very tenuous support for one or other of two hypotheses of mine:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p>It was Davis, with TEIRESIAS, who developed what we now think of as MYCIN’s explanation facility;</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>It is extremely difficult to add explanation post facto, if the knowledge representation and inference mechanism have not been designed to support it.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#mycin" name="mycin"></a>Mycin</h2>
<p>Mycin [Davis et al, 77] is perhaps the program most often seen as the starting point for expert system research, and is certainly the first system which is remembered for its explanation facilities.</p>
<h3><a href="#explanation-facilities" name="explanation-facilities"></a>Explanation Facilities</h3>
<p>What isn’t so frequently remembered is that MYCIN itself, the consulting programme, didn’t have any explanation facilities. These were provided by a separate front end module, TEIRESIAS, which was intended as a knowledge engineers tool. The point here is that the MYCIN project did not (as | understand it) expect end users to use - or need - explanations. Rather, the explanation facility was conceived as a high level debugging trace to help the knowledge engineer, presumed to be an “experienced programmer”, with knowledge of the problem domain, to discover what is going on inside the system. Consequently:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The fundamental goal of an explanation facility is to enable a program to display a comprehensible account of the motivation for all its actions.” [Davis &amp; Lenat, 82] my emphasis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The explanation tells why the machine carried out an action, not why it believes a proposition. This is justified on the grounds that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“We assume … that a recap of program actions can be an effective explanation as long as the correct level of detail is chosen.”</p>
  <p>“With a program that does symbolic reasoning, recapping offers an easily understood explanation.” [ibid]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This understanding of the explanation as simply a development of high level trace facilities is confirmed by the fact that the fragments chosen for concatenation to form the explanation are constructed by applying fixed templates to the rules. It is a (perhaps the) classic sweetened backtrace.</p>
<p>Rules were assumed to be comprehensible in themselves because they had been formulated by human experts attempting to formalise their own knowledge of the domain. As such the rules were expected to:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“…embody accepted patterns of human reasoning, implying that they should be relatively easy to understand, especially for those familiar with the domain. … They also attack the problem at what has been judged (by the expert) to be an appropriate level of detail.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The explanation is also helped by the very high level language in which the rules are expressed, with its stylised code and small number of primitive operations, which together made it easy to apply templates to transform executable code into legible English.</p>
<h4><a href="#the-why-question" name="the-why-question"></a>The WHY question</h4>
<p>The WHY question had two different semantics, depending on the mode that MYCIN was in when the question is asked. MYCIN is generally thought of (as it is) as an inference mechanism, so that the literature generally refers to MYCIN working in this mode. But before starting on an inference process on a new case, MYCIN asks a series of questions to allow it to set up the primary attributes of the objects it is instantiating. This is more akin to form filling than to rule driven behaviour.</p>
<p>In the more familiar Inference mode, TEIRESIAS response to a WHY question was to justify its action in asking the current question, by printing the rule currently being executed, in a special template. WHY is thus an ‘immediate mode’ command; it is not clear from the material whether it was possible to ask WHY any question other than the current one had been asked.</p>
<p>However, WHY queries can be repeated, to climb back up the inference trace one rule at a time.</p>
<p>In the form filling mode referred to above, WHY queries are simply responded to by printing out some canned text associated with the primary attribute being requested.</p>
<h4><a href="#the-how-question" name="the-how-question"></a>The HOW question</h4>
<p>The HOW query, by contrast, operates on a history list, and requires, as argument, a statement number. The response given is (again templated) a print out of the rule whose ’test part is given in the numbered statement. Thus there are two quite different semantics to HOW. HOW of a rule which has been evaluated will give what is in some sense a justification (by modus ponens) for belief in the statement - in this sense it might be rendered “how do you know that…”. HOW of a rule which has yet to be evaluated gives procedural information about how to find the truth value of the statement, and might be rendered “how would you find out whether…”. These different semantics are to some extent signalled by the use of different templates.</p>
<p>Some numbered statements, eg (5.0) below, do not appear to be ‘test parts’ of any rule. It is not made clear what the effect of asking ‘WHY [5.0]’ would be.</p>
<h5><a href="#example-user-input-prefixed-with-prompt-" name="example-user-input-prefixed-with-prompt-"></a>Example, user input prefixed with ’**’ prompt:</h5>
<pre><code>Where is the suspected portal  of entry of organism-1 into this sterile site?

** WHY 

[I.e., why is it important to  determine the suspected portal of entry of organism-l into this  sterile site?]

<h3><a href="#relevance-filtering" name="relevance-filtering"></a>Relevance filtering</h3>
<p>Another feature of MYCIN for rather, of TIERESIAS) which is often forgotten is the advanced relevance filtering, which has rarely been equaled by imitators.</p>
<p>Briefly the problem which gives rise to the need for filtering is this. An ‘explanation’ (at least one given in the form of a syntactically sugared inference trace) which gives all the steps used to reach a goal will, in real applications, tend to be too long and complex for the user to understand. The critical information will be lost in a mass of trivial detail. This problem does not, of course, arise with toy systems, where the knowledge base is not large enough for extended chains of inference to develop. As Davis writes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“In an explanation we must not carry reasoning too far back, or the length of our argument will cause obscurity; neither must we put in all the steps which lead to our conclusion, or we shall waste words by saying what is manifest.”</p>
  <p>“Depending on the individual user, it might be best to show all steps in a reasoning chain, to omit those that are definitional or trivial, or, for the most sophisticated user, to display only the highlights.” [Davis &amp; Lenat]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, we find Weiner writing:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“If an explanation is to be understood, it must not appear complex.” [Weiner, 80]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TIERESIAS’ relevance filter was based on the [‘certainty factor’]3 of inference steps. A function of this was used as a measure of the significance of an inference step, with inferences having a CF of 1 (true in every case) being considered to have no contribution to make to explanation, and lower certainty factors having higher indices on a logarithmic scale. This was seen as a “…clearly imperfect…” solution, but provided:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“…. a ‘dial’ with which the user can adjust the level of detail in the explanations. Absolute settings are less important than the ability to make relative adjustments.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This index of explanation abstraction could be used as an optional argument to the WHY query, as in the example:</p>
<pre><code>** WHY 4

We are trying to find out  whether the organism has been observed in significant numbers, in  order to determine an organism or class of organisms for which  therapy should cover.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>{taken from Davis and Lenat pp 269 - 270. See also ibid pp 265 - 266 for the ‘low level’ version of this reply. This is a very impressive feature which has been quite neglected in the general literature.}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This feature is further extended with an EXPLAIN command, which can be used to go over the same ground as an immediately previous WHY command, but at a different level of detail. Thus if the user tried, for example ‘WHY 10’ and got back an answer that was too sketchy, it would be possible to try ‘EXPLAIN 3’ to bring the level down. Whether the reverse would be possible - to try EXPLAIN 10 after WHY 3 - is not made clear, but it appears not, as “…the EXPLAIN command will cover the same starting and ending points in the reasoning…”.</p>
<h3><a href="#limitations-of-the-explanation-system" name="limitations-of-the-explanation-system"></a>Limitations of the explanation system</h3>
<p>Parts of the MYCIN expertise (those parts concerned with the selection of drugs are mentioned) were not encoded as rules but were coded in LISP directly. This expertise could not be explained by TIERESIAS.</p>
<p>Other limitations of the system recognised by Davis &amp; Lenat include the limited semantics of the question commands (i.e. the user was tightly constrained in what could be asked), the fact that beyond the level at which knowledge was primitive in the system, further explanations could not be given, and the lack of any user model, which might help remove unneeded detail from explanations. Furthermore, they observe that “… the system should be able to describe its actions at different conceptual levels…”.</p>
<h3><a href="#conclusion" name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>TIERESIAS is one of the earliest examples of Expert Systems explanation. It is significant that explanation was not seen as being a critical or integral part of MYCIN, but was provided in a separate programme initially intended only as an aid to knowledge engineers and not as part of the consulting system. In this context it is not surprising that it should have developed out of high level backtrace facilities familiar from LISP programming environments.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that it was a very early attack on the problem, and is in essence simply a syntactically sugared backtrace, TIERESIAS is highly sophisticated in a number of ways; notably in the provision of an effective (if crude) measure of detail, which allowed for remarkably successful abstraction of high-level explanations from the inference trace.</p>
<p>MYCIN/TEIRESIAS was undoubtedly a revolutionary system in many ways, and it has spawned many derivative systems. But it was less revolutionary than it appeared to be. The ‘explanation facilities’, which are made so much of in the literature, are not able to give declarative reasons for belief in propositions. They were not designed to, being conceptually merely very high level trace facilities for the knowledge engineer.</p>
<p>The fact that users eagerly accepted the facilities MYCIN/TEIRESIAS provided indicated that there was a demand for explanation systems.</p>
<h1><a href="#a-wide-variety-of-technical-fixes-have-been-experimented-with" name="a-wide-variety-of-technical-fixes-have-been-experimented-with"></a>A wide variety of ‘technical fixes’ have been experimented with</h1>
<p>A very wide range of approaches to the problem of providing a high level account of a system beliefs or actions have been tried. One of the interesting avenues has been that followed William Swartout, in attempting to provide ‘explanations’ of what conventional procedural programmes are doing.</p>
<h2><a href="#digitalis-therapy-advisor" name="digitalis-therapy-advisor"></a>Digitalis Therapy Advisor</h2>
<p>This is yet another medical expert system - this time dealing with the administration of digitalis to heart attack sufferers.</p>
<p>The knowledge base maintains a model of the patient’s individual response to digitalis - a highly toxic drug to which people have widely varying response - as well as general information about its properties and administration.</p>
<p>Digitalis Therapy Advisor was written in, and clearly developed with, a prototype ‘self-documenting’ language called OWL 1. This is a clearly LISP like language, which incorporates a parser which can translate programme statements into a high-level procedural account. This parser can be applied not only to pieces of code, to show what the programme would do to execute it, but also to items on the history list, to show what it has done.</p>
<h3><a href="#explanation-by-translation-of-programming-language" name="explanation-by-translation-of-programming-language"></a>Explanation by translation of programming language</h3>
<p>Explanation was a key goal in the design of the advisor programme, and the implementation of it largely exploited this feature of the underlying language. Broadly, english-language templates are associated with each primitive procedure of the language, into which the arguments passed, and on completion the results returned, can be spliced. However the programmer, when writing a new procedure, does not to need to supply templates, as the system is able to splice together the templates belonging to the primitives. As the OWL interpreter runs, it builds up an ‘event structure’, or trace, of the procedures it has called, and what their arguments were:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The system is ‘self-documenting’ in the sense that it can produce English explanations of the procedures it uses and the actions it takes directly from the code it executes. Most of its explanations are produced in this manner, although a few types of explanation are canned phrases… The explanations are designed to be understood by a physician with no programming experience.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The limitations of this approach are acknowledged, and the ’work around" used is described:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"When writing a computer program, it is sometimes necessary to use methods that are totally foreign to users of the system. This may be because the methods employed by humans are unknown, (or) too inefficient… Whenever this situation occurs, it will not be possible to provide explanations by merely translating the code of the program into English…</p>
  <p>To deal with this problem … we have attached English comments to the OWL code… When the … method is explained, the comments are displayed along with the translated OWL code."</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="#explanation-discussion" name="explanation-discussion"></a>Explanation: Discussion</h3>
<p>Essentially this is a ’syntactic sugaring system, which provides for splicing text fragments into the output where necessary. Clearly, as the methods which are executed are procedural, the explanation given is a procedural explanation, an explanation of why things were done, and not of why things were believed. It appears for example that we cannot ask why the various actions were carried out - ie what the system was attempting to achieve, as in a MYCIN ‘WHY’ question; nor why specific things are believed: for example, why ‘hypoxemia’ is one of the degradable conditions.</p>
<p>Instead of dividing the system into an inference engine and a knowledge base, the knowledge is hard-wired into OWL1 ‘methods’ (procedures). This approach appears more applicable to domains where an algorithm is available, than to the more classic ‘Expert System’ domains.</p>
<h2><a href="#xplain" name="xplain"></a>XPLAIN</h2>
<h3><a href="#general-description" name="general-description"></a>General Description</h3>
<p>Swartout’s next system, XPLAIN, grew out of the work on Digitalis Therapy Advisor, and parallels the development of in that an objective in the design was the justification of programme actions.</p>
<p>The explanation system follows DTA in which explanations were based on expansions of the actual executable code - a sophisticated variant of syntactic sugaring. Swartout argues against the use of canned text:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“There are several problems with the canned text approach. The fact that the program code and the text strings that explain that code can be changed independently makes it difficult to maintain consistency between what the program does and what it claims to do. Another problem is that all questions must be anticipated in advance… Finally, the system has no conceptual model of what it is saying… Thus, it is difficult to use this approach to provide more advanced sorts of explanations…” [Swartout 83, p 291]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But now he explores the limitations of the approach used in DTA, mentioning, in addition to those problems noted in his earlier paper [Swartout 77], that redundant and irrelevant information is included in a mechanical expansion of code:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The fact that every operation must be explicitly spelled out sometimes forces the programmer to program operations which the physician would perform without thinking…. (eg) steps which are involved more with record keeping than with medical. reasoning… Since they appear in the code, they are described in the explanation routines, although they are more likely to confuse a physician user than enlighten him. An additional problem is that it is difficult to get an overview of what is really going on…” (ibid, p 293)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again, we see that the inclusion of irrelevant material can mask the important points from the human reader.</p>
<p>Swartout’s solution to his rejection both of canned text and of syntactic sugar is to have the computer generate the expert system - called ‘the performance program’ - and simultaneously, from the same knowledge base, generates a ‘refinement structure’ which records the transformations from the input information to the performance program. This is exploited in the later construction of explanations. XPLAIN itself is thus an automatic programmer, whose purpose is to write such a system.</p>
<p>The ‘refinement structure’ is a tree of goals, each being a subgoal of the one above it, at a less abstract level. Each subgoal is succesively refined until a primitive of the underlying programming language is produced. The performance program is thus found at the leaves of the refinement structure.</p>
<p>In addition to the refinement structure, knowledge is held in a ’domain model and a collection of ‘domain principles’.</p>
<h3><a href="#generating-explanations" name="generating-explanations"></a>Generating explanations</h3>
<p>The explanation system which exploits this structure is constructed in two modules, a phrase generator, and an answer generator. The phrase generator task is to compile sections of the refinement structure into English fragments; the answer generator first chooses which sections of the refinement structure to compile, and then concatenates the generated phrases to produce the answer. In addition to generating phrases from the refinement structure, the explanation generator has access to the domain model and principles.</p>
<p>It applies relevance filtering by maintaining</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“…knowledge of the state of the program execution, knowledge of what has already been said, and knowledge of what the user is likely to be interested in. Other issues the answer generators confront include deciding whether to omit information the user can be presumed to know from the explanation and determining whether analogies can be suggested to previous explanations." [ibid, p 306]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a much more sophisticated conception of what it is relevant to tell the user than we have yet seen.</p>

<p>Points to note are that, unlike the DTA example, this explanation tells us why the system is doing what it is, rather than how it is doing it. It now resembles, conceptually, the MYCIN type WHY explanation, except that the text is noticeably more fluid. It is also worth noticing how the generator of the second explanation fragment has taken into account the information given in the earlier one. The procedural explanations, as produced by DTA, are still available. However, the system still cannot produce an account of why it holds a particular belief.</p>
<h2><a href="#apes" name="apes"></a>APES</h2>
<p>Another interest which was developing in the Artificial Intelligence community at the same time as Expert Systems was ‘Logic Programming’: implementing restricted subsets of first order predicate calculus as programming languages. The most significant of these languages was PROLOG. It was inevitable that these two strands would come together, and one of the first signs of this was APES - A PROLOG Expert System - developed Peter Hammond in the early 80s.</p>
<p>Hammond and Sergot discuss the motivation for writing an expert system in PROLOG: they show the structural similarity between the production rules used in the MYCIN family of systems and horn clauses, note that horn clauses offer greater expressive power, and claim that this will assist in the construction of :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“… knowledge bases which are more flexible, more useful, and more elegant than would be possible with less powerful languages.” [Hammond &amp; Sergot 83 p 95]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inference engine is constructed as a meta-interpreter in PROLOG, similar in concept to Walker’s Syllog [Walker et al, 87]. The explanation mechanism is a syntactic sugaring of the rule trace, clearly modelled closely on MYCIN or some derivative.</p>
<p>Explanation fragments are generated by applying english-language templates written by the knowledge engineer to the rules, which are themselves written in a strict horn-clause form.</p>

<h3><a href="#discussion" name="discussion"></a>Discussion</h3>
<p>Although PROLOG is a declarative language, and it would seem natural to provide it with a declarative explanation facility, the implementers of APES seem to have been more concerned to demonstrate that existing Expert System functionality could be implemented in PROLOG than to consider what functionality was actually desirable. Thus they provide a system which is similar to but actually cruder than MYCIN - there is, for example, no relevance filtering.</p>
<p>So this must be seen as a toy system, whose only real interest is that it demonstrates that it may be possible to build an explanation system in Prolog. It does not demonstrate that a good explanation system can be built, and it would not effectively handle a knowledge base of any size.</p>
<h2><a href="#syllog" name="syllog"></a>Syllog</h2>
<p>Syllog, like APES, is an attempt to make a fusion between Expert Systems and logic programming. In some senses it is a better thought out and better engineered attempt, as I hope to show, than APES; and this is reflected by the fact that Syllog has been employed in a number of experimental, but significant, applications, by IBM (Syllog was developed by Adrian Walker of IBM’s Thomas J Watson Research Centre).</p>
<p>Syllog is a rule based system, and like Apes, the rules are technically horn clauses - but they are expressed in a high-level rule language, which makes them easier to understand, and are termed ‘syllogisms’ by Walker - even though they clearly aren’t.</p>
<p>What makes Syllog interesting from the present view point is the explanation system, which, although lacking in interesting capabilities like relevance filtering, is that the explanation given is declarative. The technique of explanation generation is also extremely different from preceding systems, in that the rule is (conceptually, at any rate) compiled into the explanation, in something like the way that a conventional language compiler works. The system compiles reasonable English with remarkably little knowledge of the language; and indeed is very simply adapted to work in other natural languages.</p>

<p>{after [Walker et al 87], p 244}</p>
<p>These two explanations look superficially very different, but a careful reading will show that the form of the later (published 1987) explanation is simply a - very competent - syntactic sugaring of exactly the same semantic form as that of the earlier explanation.</p>
<p>Note that (in the later version) the user has to give the system exactly the proposition to be explained. This is supported by a menu system which allows the user to browse through - and pick from - templates for all the statements the system knows about. Once the user has picked a template, further menus help with filling in the blanks.</p>
<p>The slightly weird arithmetic is, as they say, sic: otherwise we see a clearly expressed declarative statement of why just this number of testers are needed. We also see that without relevance filtering, this arrangement is only suitable for relatively shallow search spaces.</p>
<p>To be fair, there is something that serves in place of a relevance filter: the top few nodes of the proof tree constructed by the inference engine are compiled into explanation fragments, which are placed on the screen; this proceeds until the screen is filled. Because (as we argued in [Mott &amp; Brooke 87] - although we were discussing a single path selected from the tree) an inference mechanism chaining backwards will generate a proof from the general to the particular, it can be assumed that a general statement of the explanation will be given first, with what follows being more and more tightly focussed detail. So that what is immediately presented on the screen is likely to be the most important - and perhaps the most relevant - part of the proof.</p>
<p>So, once again, this system should be classified as a bit ad hoc - an explanation system constructed without a lot of thought for what explanation is. However, the explanation constructed now conforms to the deductive nomological account of explanation, rather than (to use Nagel’s terminology) the genetic form. So we have arrived at last at the classic explanation form of the Philosophy of Science.</p>
<h2><a href="#arboretum" name="arboretum"></a>Arboretum</h2>
<h3><a href="#general-description" name="general-description"></a>General description</h3>
<p>Arboretum is more completely described in a later chapter, so I will not go into any great detail here. The system was built to demonstrate a decision procedure for a novel non-monotonic logic developed by Peter Mott. The other major innovation of the system was the graphical presentation of rules and of inference traces: this feature has been seen by others as a form of explanation, but is not my central interest here. The generation of textual explanation was not part of the original conception but was added in an ad-hoc manner during implementation.</p>
<p>The explanation system, as we wrote, depended on:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“… the fact that DTrees (the knowledge representation used) are structured through exceptions from the very general to the more abstruse and particular; and that, in consequence, any path through a rule structure follows a coherent argument, again from the general to the particular. ” [Mott &amp; Brooke 87, p 110]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This allowed us to attach an explanation fragment to each node, knowing that each implied a unique conclusion for the structure in which it appeared. We used fragments of canned text, because we found this allowed us to produce more fluid explanations, but as we noted:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“… there is no reason why the system should not be modified to generate explanation fragments itself, for example by using a text macro similar to ‘<feature of="" root-node=""> was found to be <colour of="" stick-node=""> because <feature of="" stick-node=""> was true’.” [Ibid, p 111]</feature></colour></feature></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="#relevence-filtering" name="relevence-filtering"></a>Relevence filtering</h3>
<p>The most interesting feature of this explanation system was that fortuitously, the evaluation process enabled us to extract precisely that clause in each rule which was relevant to the eventual outcome. We also developed a neat heuristic to the effect that, when generating a ‘no’ explanation, we should:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“… concatenate the explanation fragments from the deepest sticking node in each successive tree on the search path. The reason is that this represents the ‘nearest’ that the claimant got to succeeding in the claim… In the case of a ‘yes’ decision we chose the opposite approach and select the shallowest sticking node available… it is not relevent to describe how a long and tortuous inference path finally delivered ‘yes’ when a much shorter, less involved one, did so too.” [Ibid]</p>

<p>It will be seen that this is a short, clear, declarative statement in seemingly natural English, which covers all (and only) the relevant points of a complex case. To be fair, the system does not always do this well, but most of its explanations are of this quality.</p>
<h1><a href="#attempts-at-more-principled-approaches" name="attempts-at-more-principled-approaches"></a>Attempts at more principled approaches</h1>
<p>After a long series of systems, such as those just described, in which the approach taken to explanation generation was essentially one of ad hoc mechanisms and technical fixes, systems began to emerge in the late 1970’s which took a more principled approach to the problem. One of the first of these was BLAH.</p>
<h2><a href="#blah" name="blah"></a>BLAH</h2>
<h3><a href="#general-description" name="general-description"></a>General description</h3>
<p>This system sought to address issues of explanation structuring and complexity. Like XPLAIN, it sought to reduce detail by maintaining a model of what the user could be expected to know. However, its design was based on studies of human explanation behaviour, described in [Goguen et al., 83] and in [Wiener 1979).</p>
<p>This system is also interesting in that for the first time we see declarative explanations:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The third type of question (supported by BLAH) is a request to BLAH to explain why some assertion, already in the knowledge base, is believed.” [Weiner 80, p 20]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inference mechanism used was written in AMORD [de Kleer et al., ’78] with a truth maintenance sub-system described in [Doyle, 78]. Essentially this appears to be a production system.</p>
<p>The knowledge base contains assertions, each of which is supported by a list of other assertions which tend to justify belief in it, and optionally, a list of assertions which tend to question such belief. Justifications are based on a set of rules: PREMISE, STATEMENT/REASON, REASON/STATEMENT, IF/THEN, THEN/IF, AND, OR, GENERAL/SPECIFIC, EXAMPLES, and ALTERNATIVES; these are claimed to derive from justifications used by subjects in the studies of natural explanation. Each rule has associated with it a series of alternative templates into which the predicates and instantiated variables can be patched.</p>
<p>Two parallel views of this knowledge base are maintained: a system view and a user’s view.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“… When a user poses a question to BLAH, BLAH uses the knowledge in the system’s view to reason about it; and when BLAH generates an explanation, it uses knowledge in the user’s view to determine (by reasoning) what information the user already knows, so that it can be deleted from the explanation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The system’s view is built by the knowledge engineer; information given by the user is added to the user’s view, and information generated by the inference process is added to both.</p>
<p>The knowledge base is also segmented into ‘partitions’ based on category; and further divided into separate ‘hypothetical worlds’; these last being used, presumably, by the truth maintenance system.</p>
<p>The inference process generates a tree having at its terminals instantiated statements about the case, and at its non-terminals justification types, drawn from those listed above. This structure is passed to the explanation generator, which generates text by applying templates which are associated with the justification types. These templates, as well as english-ifying the system’s statements, have the power to reorder the nodes of the tree below them, for example by converting an IF/THEN justification type to a THEN/IF. The reorderings are intended to improve the explanation structure.</p>
<p>However before applying the templates it prunes the tree by removing all those statements which the user is presumed to know (those which can be derived from the user’s view of the knowledge base), and which have no dependents, using a bottom up, right to left search; and then further prunes the tree by removing sub-trees which are considered to contain detail.</p>
<p>The primary measure of detail used is a function of the depth of the explanation tree, but trees are also pruned for complexity if any node has more than two dependents.</p>
<p>Where complexity pruning has been used, explanations generated from the excised sub-trees are successively appended to the original explanation. A meaningless interjection (“uh”) apparently culled from the study of human explanation is used as a marker that this has been done!</p>
<p>The length of the explanation is thus clearly a function of the size (number of nodes) of the explanation tree, but with the rider that splitting the tree in order to improve the explanation structure will actually LENGTHEN the explanation. Wiener claims this as a benefit:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“As we see in (9), by copying a node from one tree to another we cause the text associated with that node to be repeated in the explanation. As [Halliday and Hassan 76] point out, repetition is one factor which influences the view that sentences, although separate, are tied together to form a unified text.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BLAH provided three top level facilities to the user. These were of the form:</p>
<pre><code>(SHOW  &lt;assertion&gt;)
-&gt;  &lt;assertion&gt;
(CHOICE  &lt;assertion1&gt;&lt;assertion2&gt;{&lt;category  partition&gt;})
-&gt; (I CHOSE  &lt;assertionX&gt;) (NOT (I CHOSE &lt;assertionY&gt;))
(EXPLAIN  &lt;explanation&gt;)
-&gt;  &lt;explanation&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Although these are all LISP like in form (indeed the assertions themselves are in the form of lists), it is not clear whether the user had the option of entering:</p>
<pre><code>(EXPLAIN (SHOW  &lt;assertion&gt;))
</code></pre>
<h3><a href="#example-explanation-" name="example-explanation-"></a>Example explanation:</h3>
<pre><code>Well, Peter makes less than 750  dollars, and Peter is under 19, and
Harry supports Peter so Peter  is a dependent of Harry's. Uh Peter
makes less than 750 dollars  because Peter does not work, and Peter
is a dependent of Harry's  because Harry provides more than one half
of Peter's  support.
</code></pre>
<p>I should explain that the application is to the US Federal Income Tax system. This explanation does indeed capture something of the flavour of a natural spoken explanation. Furthermore, it is clearly declarative rather than procedural. However, personally, I find its style rather too informal for textual presentation. I particularly dislike the meaningless ‘Uh’ which is use to tag the supporting point.</p>
<h3><a href="#discussion" name="discussion"></a>Discussion</h3>
<p>With this system we can begin to construct a model of what the designers have meant by explanation, and relate it to the philosophical work to be described in the following chapter. The form of the explanation is essentially the deductive-nomological explanation, as described by Hempel, but there are subtleties. The deductive nomological form essentially requires that the explanation must be given in terms of things which can be verified by reference to the world; we will discuss the meaning of this later. But BLAH’S explanations are given simply in terms of things which BLAH knows that the user knows, making the assumption that the user can supply the rest of the argument.</p>
<h2><a href="#attending" name="attending"></a>ATTENDING</h2>
<h3><a href="#general-description" name="general-description"></a>General Description</h3>
<p>ATTENDING takes a radically novel approach to the problem of assisting decision making in complex domains: it works by inviting the user to describe a case, and to then describe the proposed course of action. The machine reviews the proposals, and produces a critique. The critique is generated by fragment concatenation, and appears to be of high quality, with very natural seeming english. The application described [Miller, 84] is medical, considering plans for the anaesthetisation of patients requiring surgery.</p>
<h3><a href="#explanation-system" name="explanation-system"></a>Explanation System</h3>
<p>The explanation system is provided with limited ability to prevent repetitiousness by allowing the fragment concatenator to follow alternative routes at points in the knowledge base, thus allowing for differently worded explanations of the same inference.</p>
<h3><a href="#interaction-style" name="interaction-style"></a>Interaction Style</h3>
<p>The input methods are crude in the extreme, however, with the user being presented with fairly brief menus of options to describe the case being handled. Thus courses of action not foreseen by the knowledge engineer cannot be described, and, consequently, cannot be criticised</p>
<h3><a href="#inference-mechanism" name="inference-mechanism"></a>Inference mechanism</h3>
<p>The explanation generator is based on the knowledge representation chosen, which is a variant of the Augmented Transition Network and is called an ‘Augmented Decision Network’. The nodes of this network are ‘states’ which the patient may be in. These states are joined by arcs, labelled with actions which may move the patient from the initial to the consequent state of the arc. Each arc also holds a list of risks and benefits consequent on the action. Where a choice of arc exists between two nodes, the arc whose total risks scores least will be prefered; where more than one arc has no risks associated with it, the arc whose total benefits score most will be preffered. Fragments (it is interesting to note that the author uses the word) are stored on arcs of futher transition nets, which are themselves expansions of the arcs in the decision net., and the explanation generator chooses a path through this net collecting and concatenating fragments along the way.</p>
<h3><a href="#redundancy-filtering" name="redundancy-filtering"></a>Redundancy filtering</h3>
<p>The concatenator maintains lists of topics mentioned at sentence, paragraph, and text level, and uses these to prevent redundancy. Where a topic is mentioned a second or subsequent time, a template is substituted for the reference. Thus it is clear that the fragments are more complex than just strings; they must also have some information about their content, in machine handleable form.</p>
<h3><a href="#explanation-discussion" name="explanation-discussion"></a>Explanation: Discussion</h3>
<p>This principled approach to explanation generation is seen as more sophisticated than the ’if x and y and z then print “this is an explanation” school of explanation generation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Many systems which produce prose output use a fairly ad-hoc approach. Sentences and sentence fragments are stored in the machine as ‘Canned Text’. The control of the generation of this ‘canned text’ is embedded in the procedural logic, often in an ad-hoc way.</p>
  <p>This approach can work well if the system’s discussion is straightforward and predictable. If complex analysis is attempted, however, and the system designer wants flexibility for the discussion to vary depending on the particulars of the content, then this approach can become quite unwieldy.</p>
  <p>There are a number of drawbacks. 1] the programming of the discussion itself becomes difficult. 2] Any major revision of the prose output may involve substantial reprogramming. 3] The logic that generates the prose expression may become hopelessly interwoven with the logic that determines and organises the content of the material to be discussed." p 56</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strategy used is described as less ambitious than schemes which involve constructing explanations from semantic information generated by an inference mechanism. This is seen to be a research problem in itself.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Attending has set itself an intermediate goal: developing a flexible formalism to facilitate the generation of polished prose. Although the PROSENET approach is clearly closer in spirit to canned text generation than to sophisticated language generation it does allow the system designer great flexibility to maipulate, massage, and refine the system’s prose output, independent of the rest of the system’s analysis.” [Miller 84 p77] (Miller’s emphasis)</p>
  <p>“From the standpoint of computer science, critiquing can be perceived as a mode of explanation which lets a system structure its advice around the particular concerns of the user in a direct and natural way.” [Miller 84 p 74] (Miller’s emphasis).</p>
  <p>“…critiquing allows the physician to be the final decision maker. The computer is never forced to commit itself to one approach or another.” [Ibid]</p>

<p>"Just as Thompson’s lookup program displayed exasperating shallowness, so total lookahead has its own ‘mentality’ which from the point of view of the human questioner could be described as impenetrably deep. While the response of lookup is instantaneous, lookahead ruminates through combinatorially vast ramifications while constructing its forward tree of possibilities. Long rumination before each reply is not of course in itself a guarantee of mental depth. But when asked how it selected its move, lookahead is able to make an exceptionally profound response by disgorging the complete analysis tree. This comprises not only a complete strategy but at the same time… a complete justification of the strategy. Could anyone wish for a more profound response?</p>
<p>“On the contrary, mortal minds are overwhelmed by so much reactive detail. Reporting on the Three Mile Island nuclear plant accident the Malone committee stated that …. the operator was bombarded with displays, warning lights, print-outs and so on to the point where detection of any error condition and the assessment of the right action to correct the condition was impossible’. So lookahead, with a quite opposite mentality from lookup, has its own reasons for inability to interact helpfully with a human.” [ Michie, 83; Michie’s emphasis]</p>

I take as evidence the following: the assertion [Davis and Lenat 1982 p 276] that …. the current performance program (is) MYCIN’, together with the diagram [ ibid., p 243 figure 2-3] which clearly shows that the explanation module is outside the performance program. To support my argument that the explanation mechanism described in [Davis et al. 1977] - the MYCIN paper - is in fact the TEIRESIAS explanation module, compare e.g. the discussion of information metrics [Davis and Lenat p 269] with [Davis et al p 36]; and the sample explanations given in the two sources.</p>
<p>3 MYCIN/TEIRESIAS used “certainty factors” (not to be confused with formal indices of probability) to express its confidence in steps of reasoning. These were entered by the Knowledge Engineer for the individual rules, and manipulated arithmetically by the inference mechanism. They ranged in value from -1 (certainly false) through to (no confidence at all in the reasoning step) to 1 (certainty). </p>
